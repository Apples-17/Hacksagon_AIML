#  AI Sentinel Pro — Real-Time Smart Surveillance System

AI Sentinel Pro is an intelligent computer-vision based surveillance system that detects intrusions inside restricted zones from video feeds and triggers real-time alerts with sound and visual notifications.

It uses YOLOv8 object detection, multi-object tracking, and zone intelligence to simulate a real-world automated security monitoring solution.

##  Features

### Intelligent Detection
- Real-time human detection using YOLOv8
- Multi-object tracking using ByteTrack
- Persistent ID assignment for each person

### Restricted Zone Monitoring
- User-configurable detection area
- Intrusion detection based on feet position (accurate entry detection)
- Adjustable alert sensitivity to avoid false alarms

### Smart Alerts
- Live alert panel
- Timestamped violations
- Automatic beep alarm
- Cooldown system to prevent alert spam

### Interactive Dashboard
- Built using Streamlit
- Real-time calibration preview
- Adjustable AI confidence threshold
- Dark themed UI

---

##  How It Works

1. User uploads a video feed
2. System detects people in each frame
3. Tracker assigns unique IDs
4. Feet position is checked inside restricted zone
5. If a person stays longer than threshold → alert triggered

##  Installation

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-sentinel-pro.git
cd ai-sentinel-pro
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Model Weights
The application will automatically download the YOLOv8 model (`yolov8n.pt`) during first run.
